# Example data for abc-classroom

This directory contains two files.

**config.yml**

The template config file. When you run `abc-quickstart`, it copies this config into the new course directory and updates the `course_directory` key. Because this file is used by **abc-classroom**, do not modify this file directly. If you aren't using `abc-quickstart` and you want to create your own config, make a copy and modify the copy.

**sample_roster.csv**

A sample course roster (matching the format downloaded from [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)). This file is not used by **abc-classroom** directly. It is only provided here for reference.
