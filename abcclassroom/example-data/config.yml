  README.md:
  - \nThis repository contains the notebooks for this week's assignment.
  - Complete the homework in each .ipynb notebook, commit your work, and
  - push the changes to github. Your instructor will pull the completed
  - assignment after the deadline.
  - \nOnce grading is complete, your instructor will push the results to a
  - file called `feedback.html`. You will need to pull the changes to your
  - local copy and open this file in a browser to view (github will not
  - render html files).
