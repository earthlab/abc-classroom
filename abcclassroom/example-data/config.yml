# Create a new organization on GitHub and change this to the name you gave it
organization: earth-analytics-edu

# Name of your course. Will be used to prefix repositories inside the
# organization. The repositories will be named:
# https://github.com/<organization>/<courseName>-template
# https://github.com/<organization>/<courseName>-<studentName>
# or, if short_classname (below) is set:
# https://github.com/<organization>/<short_classname>-template
# https://github.com/<organization>/<short_classname>-<studentName>
course_name: earth-analytics-bootcamp

# Absolute path to the course directory. If you ran abc-quickstart, this was
# set up for you
course_directory: /Users/karen/awesome-course

# (Optional) Short name for course. If set, this gets used to prepend
# the repositories instead of the full course_name, just to make
# names shorter and less unwieldy
short_coursename: ea

# Path to the course roster (list of students downloaded from
# github classroom). If the roster is in the course_directory, simply enter
# the filename (otherwise, enter the path relative to the course_directory).

# you enter an absolute path (i.e. starting with '/' on Linux or OS X or with
# 'C:' on Windows).
nbgrader_dir: nbgrader

# Path to the directory where you want to clone the student repositories.
# Assumed to be relative to course_dir unless you enter an absolute path (i.e. starting with '/' on Linux or OS X or with 'C:' on Windows). None of the

clone_dir: /Users/me/awesome-course/cloned_dirs


# Path to the assignment template repositories. Again, none of
# the parent directories should be a git repo. Assumed to be relative to
