roster
======

Enter the path to the classroom roster. If you enter a bare filename,
`abc-classroom` will look in the course directory for the file. If your
roster file is somewhere else, you can enter a full path to the file,
e.g. `/home/user/directory/filename.csv`. 

Default: `roster: classroom_roster.csv`
