Get Started Using ABC_Classroom
===============================

The **abc-classroom** package is designed for course instructors who are
using GitHub Classroom to distribute and collect assignments to and from  students.

abc-classroom allows and supports the use of ``nbgrader`` to implement grading.
However ``nbgrader`` is not required.

The instructions in this section will lead you through installing **abc-classroom**, setting
up authentication with GitHub, and creating
a new **abc-classroom** course. It is also helpful to read through the :doc:`overview`
to understand the **abc-classroom** workflow.
