ABC-Classroom Quickstart
------------------------

To set up a template directory to run abc-classroom in, run:

    $ abc-quickstart

This will create a directory for you that contains pre-made directories for templates and cloned files, as well as
a sample ``config.yml`` file that can be modified to run the program for your classroom. ``abc-quickstart`` has
two arguments that can be used to modify its functionality.

1. ``--course_name course-repo-custom-name-here`` This argument will allow you to modify the name of the main
repository ``abc-quickstart`` will create.
2. ``-f Boolean`` This argument will allow you to override an existing output from ``abc-quickstart``. Doing this will
delete anything currently in your course directory, but will allow you to start over fresh.
