Welcome to abc-classroom's documentation!
=========================================

``abc-classroom`` is a python package that automates some of the integration between local development / marking of lesson material and distribution through `GitHub Classroom <https://classroom.github.com/>`_. It supports (but does not require) `nbgrader <https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader>`_ for managing and autograding notebooks.
